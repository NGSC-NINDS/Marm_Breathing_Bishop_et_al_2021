# [Installation: How to install the Python environment]
Download the pleth_script.yaml file from the GitHub. Move the file to a desired directory.

Ensure that Anaconda or Miniconda is installed (https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html)

In Terminal (Mac) or Anaconda Prompt (Windows), navigate to the directory where pleth_script.yaml is located. Then, type:

`conda env create -f pleth_script.yaml`   to create the Python environment.

Once the packages are installed, type   `conda activate pleth` to activate the environment. 

Typing `conda deactivate` will deactivate the current environment and return to the base environment. From the base environment, you can now use `conda activate pleth` to return to the script environment, with all dedicated packages installed.

Now that all the packages are installed, you can move onto using the script!
